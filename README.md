# Assignment 11 - TSP

The attached file [`weights.txt`](weights.txt) contains 13 sections separated by empty lines.  Each section starts with the first two letters of a student name, followed by a weight matrix for a complete, undirected graph with 13 nodes.  Your job is to write a program to find a cycle of minimum total weight that passes through all nodes of an undirected graph.  You can use library functions for your favorite language.  To test it, use the weight matrix associated to your name.  Please submit your code, an optimum cycle, and its total weight.
